Intro:

This is my dotfiles repo. I've created it to help me use the same configs across multiple systems.
It is nowhere near as advanced as some others, it is really more of a convenience for me.

If you'd like to really see how this is done, check these repos:

https://github.com/grosser/dotfiles
https://github.com/nel/dotfiles
https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles
https://github.com/aviflombaum/dotfiles
https://github.com/drnic/.dotfiles

Install:

There is a simple install.sh script which will create the appropriate links in your $HOME based on your OS.

cd ~
git clone git://github.com/humanshell/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
